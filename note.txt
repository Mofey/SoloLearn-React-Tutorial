React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for front-end web applications.

Here are some of the advantages of React:

Speed
Interactive websites need to update the DOM (Document Object Model) each time a change happens. This process is generally resourceful and slow.
Compared to other libraries that manipulate the DOM, React uses a Virtual DOM, allowing to update only the parts of the website that have changed. This increases the speed of updates dramatically, as modern web applications may contain thousands of elements.

Ease of Use
React allows developers to group related code together, thereby making building and maintaining large scale applications much less complex.

Support
React has an amazingly large community and is open source. It is maintained by Facebook and the community.



Props vs State

As a recap, here is a summary of the main differences between props and state:

- We use props to pass data to components.
- Components use state to manage their data.
- Props are read-only and cannot be modified.
- State can be modified by its component using the setState() method.
- The setState() method results in re-rendering the component affected.

Components that have state are called stateful, while components that do not use state are called stateless.






Summary of our Contact Manager App
An important takeaway from this lesson is that props can be used to pass down not only state, but also functions, that may manipulate the state.
This way, we are able to store the application state in the parent and allow its child components to use and manipulate the state.
Now, when our app is fully functional, we can add some CSS styles and a check, to prevent creation of blank contacts.

Explore the project, try to modify the code and add attributes to our contacts, such as age, location, phone number.
